# Run Track

## Small experiment with preact, hooks and no build tools

Needed a small simple site to keep track of my running on the go. I also wanted to checkout a super minimal aproach with preact and wanted something quick. I like react and hooks so here we go.

Probably doing it all wrong. Tell me how to improve. Sorry the code is a bit crappy.

## How to use

Don't use for now.
I'm using [jsonbin](https://jsonbin.io/) to store the data (minimal free approach). So you need to setup a bin with some data and get an api secret key. Then add to the site and you can start adding runs.
